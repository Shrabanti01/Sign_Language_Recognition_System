# Bengali Sign Language Recognition System  

## Overview  
This project recognizes **Bengali Sign Language** gestures in real-time using **MediaPipe** and **LSTM**. It provides a web-based interface to help bridge communication gaps for the Bengali-speaking deaf community.  

## Features  
- **Real-time Gesture Recognition** using deep learning.  
- **Web-based Interface** for easy accessibility.  
- **Custom Dataset** for Bengali sign language.  
- **Instructional Videos** to help users learn gestures.  

## Technologies Used  
- **MediaPipe** – Hand tracking and gesture detection.  
- **LSTM** – Sequential deep learning for recognition.  
- **Flask** – Backend.  

## Future Work  
- Expand the gesture vocabulary.  
- Develop a mobile application.  
- Add real-time speech conversion.
